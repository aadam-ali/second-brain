# Second Brain

This repository supercedes what was once my notes repository (https://github.com/Aadam-Ali/notes)

While the name of this project is inspired by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.com/), who
who has written a book about [Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book), it doesn't follow the structure which he suggests. Though, I must disclaim that I've not read the book but have watched through his [short YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Mfl1OywM8&list=PLVNXAaej57W6qCYoMb_hbzDhX9et_GVlj&pp=iAQB) on the topic.

The workflow and structure that I intend on using is influenced by the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method popularised by [Niklas Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) but is **not** the Zettelkasten method itself.

This project will only contain the public part of my second brain, which contains notes that I'm happy to be made public i.e. not personal or work related. For the best experience of exploring these notes I suggest using Obsidian, which is what I use as a GUI despite using (neo)vim to do most of my writing.
