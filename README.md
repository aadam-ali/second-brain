# Second Brain

This repository supercedes what was once my notes repository
(https://github.com/Aadam-Ali/notes)

While the name of this project is inspired by [Tiago
Forte](https://fortelabs.com/), who who has written a book about
[Building a Second Brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book), it
doesn't follow the structure which he suggests. Though, I must disclaim
that I've not read the book but have watched through his [short YouTube
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Mfl1OywM8&list=PLVNXAaej57W6qCYoMb_hbzDhX9et_GVlj&pp=iAQB)
on the topic.

The workflow and structure that I intend on using is influenced by the
[Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) method
popularised by [Niklas
Luhmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) but is **not**
the Zettelkasten method itself.

This project will only contain the public part of my second brain, which
contains notes that I'm happy to be made public i.e. not personal or
work related. For the best experience of exploring these notes I suggest
using Obsidian, which is GUI I use despite using (neo)vim to do most of
my writing.

## Honourable Mentions

The two following blogposts reminded me of my original intention of
building a 'second brain' and inspired a rewrite of the
[`second-brain-cli`](https://github.com/aadam-ali/second-brain-cli) to
reduce the barrier of entry for writing notes.
