# Syncing Notes

There are two categories of notes that I maintain, public and private.

Public notes are synced with GitHub to the
[`aadam-ali/second-brain`](https://github.com/aadam-ali/second-brain)
repository.

Private notes are synced across devices using Syncthing, excluding work
notes, which are only stored on work systems.
