   (or the Obsidian app if on mobile)
2. All notes SHOULD be written using Vim or Neovim<sup>1</sup> (or the
   Obsidian app if on mobile)
3. Filenames MUST only contain alphanumeric characters, underscores, and
   hyphens, and MUST start and end with an alphanumeric character
4. Backlinks MUST be relative, URL-encoded GitHub Flavoured Markdown
