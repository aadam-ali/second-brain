title: OSI Model
---
The OSI model is a conceptual model that allows different devices to
communicate using standard protocols.

It is based on splitting communication systems into 7 abstract layers.

| Layer | Name                                                    | Description                                                      |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 7     | [Application](OSI%20Model%20Application%20Layer%207.md) | Allows software to initiate network communication                |
| 6     | Presentation                                            | Prepares data so that it can be used by the application layer    |
| 5     | Session                                                 | Opens and closes the session between two devices                 |
| 4     | [Transport](OSI%20Model%20Transport%20Layer%204.md)     | Responsible for the end to end communication between two devices |
| 3     | [Network](OSI%20Model%20Network%20Layer%203.md)         | Facilitates data transfer between two different networks         |
| 2     | Data link                                               | Facilitates data transfer between devices on the same network    |
| 1     | Physical                                                | The equipment used in the data transfer e.g. cables and switches |
