# OSI Model

The OSI model is a conceptual model that allows different devices to
communicate using standard protocols.

It is based on splitting communication systems into 7 abstract layers.

|Layer|Name|Description|
|-----|----|-----------|
|7|Application| Allows software to initiate network communication|
|6|Presentation| Prepares data so that it can be used by the application layer|
|5|Session| Opens and closes the session between two devices|
|4|Transport| Responsible for the end to end communication between two devices|
|3|Network| Facilitates data transfer between two different networks|
|2|Data link| Facilitates data transfer between devices on the same network|
|1|Physical| The equipment used in the data transfer e.g. cables and switches|
