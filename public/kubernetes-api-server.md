# Kubernetes API Server

The API server is the front door to Kubernetes, all requests to view and
modify the state of the cluster go through it - even internal control
plane services communicate through it. When requests come into the API
server, it queries or updates the current state in the cluster store.

It's a RESTful API server that is exposed over HTTPS and handles
authorisation and authentication of requests.
